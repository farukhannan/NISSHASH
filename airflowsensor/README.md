# Air Flow Sensor Concept

We are applying a technique something called hot wire air flow sensor. The concept is to heating up a piece of platinum wire. We can grab this by removing the cover of a better quality PT100 sensor. Platinum is known as the best heat conducting element. Then we place the platinum sensor inside the breathing inlet tube. We heat up the sensor by applying a constant current about 35mA. So the PT100 sensor heats up to near 65 Degree Celsius. The air flow in the breathing inlet tube reduces the temperature of the sensor proportionally. That causes the decrease of resistance of the PT100 sensor. We added the PT100 sensor to a whetstone bridge and a differential amplifier to measure the resistance change between airflow and non-airflow.
